Description: A flexible tool that can perform
    (i) traditional non-compartmental analysis (NCA) and
    (ii) Simulation-based posterior predictive checks for population
    pharmacokinetic (PK) and/or pharmacodynamic (PKPD) models using 
    NCA metrics. The methods are described in Acharya et al. (2016) 
    <doi:10.1016/j.cmpb.2016.01.013>.
